# N-BEATS

In this project we experiment with N-BEATS, a neural network architecture designed for time series forecasting, proposed in the paper N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437)

This repository is forked from the official implementation https://github.com/ElementAI/N-BEATS and wraps the model in a new class that makes training, forecasting and evaluating it easier. Our personal work can be found in Notebook.ipynb and Report.pdf
